<p>A context-free grammar is a way of representing languages using variables together with rules for
how those variables can be converted into alphabet symbols.</p>

<p>One motivation for it comes from linguistics(or from 
programming languages), as you might infer from the name “grammar”.The idea is that in linguistic,you 
might have variables like S denoting a sentence,N denoting a noun,V denoting a verb,and A denoting an adjective,together with ruls for how a sentence might
decompose into these constituent parts of speech.
For examle,you might have a rule \(S\rightarrow NV\)
to denote that a sentence wight decompose into a noun 
followed by a verb.You could have antoher ruls line \(S\rightarrow ANV\) to denote that a sentence might instead decompose into an adjective,noun,verb sequence.
You could then alos have rules that alow a variables A,N and V to turn into real words:for example,\(N\rightarrow&lt;John&gt;\) mieght be a rule.</p>

<p>Such collections of variable and rules are called “context-free grammas”. They are sometimes used in linguistics as well as programming languages, where
one needs to formally define the synmatx of a language.</p>

<p>In this course,our context-free grammasrs(CFGs) might look something like this 
\begin{equation}
S \rightarrow XY
X \rightarrow 0X1
Y \rightarrow 2Y
X \rightarrow \epsilon
Y \rightarrow 3
\end{equation}
The interpretation of this will be as follows. The capital letters S,X,and Y are called variables.One
variable,usually denoted S is spetial: it is called the start variable.The expression sush as \(X\rightarrow 0X1\) are called rules,and tell us how
we are allowed to turn the variable on the left (in this case X) into a new string of varialbes and alphabets symbols.To generate a string from a context-free grammar,we start with the start varialbe S,and use any number of rules(in any order) to replace the variables with other strings,until we get a tring that has only alphabet symbols and no varailbes;such a string is said to be generated by the contex-free grammar.</p>

DSRG has been motivated by the desire to realize the SRG transformation using a 
formalism similar to that of unitary CC theory\cite{Evangelista:2014kt,Li:2019fu}.
%% srg
Initially formulated by Wegner\cite{Wegner:1994kh} and by Glazek and Wilson\cite{Giazek:1993ik}, the SRG has been extensively applied in various areas of physics\cite{Xu2024b, Parzuchowski:2016vi, Morris2015}.
The essence of the SRG formalism is to perform a continuous unitary (similarity) transformation of the Hamiltonian to 
drive it to a diagonal or block-diagonal form.
\begin{equation}
H(s)=U^\dagger(s)HU(s) \implies \frac{dH(s)}{ds}=[\eta(s),H(s)]
\end{equation}
where \(s\in [0,\infty]\) is time-like flow parameter,and generator \(\eta(s)\equiv \frac{d U(s)^\dagger}{ds}U(s)\) implicitly defines the unitary transformation.
The SRG flow equation with the Wegner generator has the structure of a double bracket equation\cite{Helmke1994}. 
 \begin{equation}
 \eta=[H^d(s),H(s)] \implies dH=[[H^d(s),H(s)],H(s)]
 \end{equation}
where \(H^d\) is the defined “diagonal” parts of Hamiltonian.
In mathematical literature, this is recognized as a gradient flow on a manifold of unitary matrices\cite{BROCKETT199179}.
One of the most important features of the SRG transformation is its ability to separate energy scales in the Hamiltonian. 
A second-order perturbative analysis of the SRG flow reveals that the off-diagonal matrix elements decay exponentially with the flow parameter $s$:
\begin{equation}
    H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(s) \approx e^{-s \Delta_{ij}^2} H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(0),
\end{equation}
where \(H^{\text{od}}\) denotes the off-diagonal parts of the Hamiltonian, and \(\Delta_{ij} = H_{ii}^{d} - H_{jj}^{d}\) is the energy gap between the $i$-th and $j$-th diagonal (zeroth-order) states. 
This exponential damping suppresses couplings between states with large energy differences (\(|\Delta_{ij}| \gg 1/\sqrt{s}\)), while preserving couplings between quasidegenerate states (\(|\Delta_{ij}| \lesssim 1/\sqrt{s}\)).
However, the Wegner generator has a notable drawback: it produces a stiff set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) due to the non-uniform decay rates of different off-diagonal elements.
To address this issue, alternative generators have been proposed. For instance, the White generator and the “imaginary time” generator induce uniform suppression of all off-diagonal elements.
\begin{equation}
    H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(s) \approx e^{-s} H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(0).
    \label{eq:uniform_decay}
\end{equation}
Another distinctive feature of the Wegner generator becomes apparent when examining the second-order correlation energy expression.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
    E_i^{(2)}(s)=  \sum_{k\neq i } \frac{H_{ik}^2}{\Delta_{ik}} [ 1 - e^{-2s\Delta_{ik}^2} ]
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This expression can be viewed as a regularized generalization of ordinary Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory. The regularization factor \(\left[1 - e^{-2s\Delta_{ik}^2}\right]\) ensures that the energy remains finite even when two zeroth-order states become degenerate (\(\Delta_{ik} \rightarrow 0\)), thereby providing intrinsic protection against the intruder-state problem.

The Driven Similarity Renormalization Group (DSRG) was initially formulated by Evangelista as an integrated version of the SRG formalism the continuous SRG flow\cite{Evangelista:2014kt}.
 DSRG employs a memory-less source operator \(\hat{R}(s)\) that drives the off-diagonal components of the Hamiltonian to zero as \(s \rightarrow \infty\).
This approach replaces the set of stiff ordinary differential equations in SRG with a system of algebraic equations that are solved at each value of the flow parameter $s$.
The DSRG parametrizes the unitary transformation using an anti-Hermitian operator , analogous to unitary coupled cluster theory.
\begin{equation}
    U(s)=e^{\hat A(s)} \quad \hat{A}(s) = \hat{T}(s) - \hat{T}^\dagger(s)
\end{equation}
The cluster operator \(\hat T(s)\) is determined by the many-body-condtion
\begin{equation}
    \hat H(s)^{od}=\hat R(s)
\end{equation}
Crucially, the source operator \(\hat{R}(s)\) is chosen to incorporate the same regularization factor as the SRG with the Wegner generators making the DSRG intrinsically protected against the intruder-state problem.
Soon after, Li and Evangelista presented a DSRG-MRPT\cite{Li:2015iz}, and the iterative multireference method MR-LDSRG(2)\cite{Li:2016hb},
where ‘L’ denotes “linearized” since only the linear commutator is evaluated and ‘(2)’ 
signals that only up to two-body operators are retained in the recursive linear commutator expansion.
Many application have show DSRG is very good \cite{Li2025,Zhao2025}.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an introduction when I write an introduction ,but I decided to delete it.
