## Background
QUESTDB( https://lcpq.github.io/QUESTDB_website/ )
is quantum excited state database which benchmark quantum chemistry method for excited state.
The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters 2020 116, 2374-2383
DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c00014
##  Develop theories for excited is more complex
1. excited state lack a proper vairational principle
2. excited state have very difference natures ( $$\pi->\pi*$$,$$n->\pi*$$ charge transfer ,double excitateion ,valence ,Rydberg ,singlet ,triplet )

## Method
1. first ab initial method for excited was CIS in 1970 , error ~1 eV, CIS(D) has error 0.2-0.3 eV
2. CASSCF and CASPT2,NEVPT2 is more reliable and has error 0.1-0.2
3. TD-DFT 0.2-0.4 ev for low lying valence excited state, but not goot for charge-transfer , Rydberg state and double excitation.
4. EOM-CCSD 0.1 eV
5. ADC (2) 0.1-0.2 ev  ADC(3) 
6. BSE GW  0.1-0.3 EV
7. selected CI (SCI)
