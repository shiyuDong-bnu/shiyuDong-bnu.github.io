This is an introduction when I write an introduction ,but I decided to delete it. But this part is
what most intresting part of the whole theory in my eyes.So I keep it here for reminder.
##  Introduction

DSRG has been motivated by the desire to realize the SRG transformation using a 
formalism similar to that of unitary CC theory\cite{Evangelista:2014kt,Li:2019fu}.

Initially formulated by Wegner\cite{Wegner:1994kh} and by Glazek and Wilson\cite{Giazek:1993ik}, the SRG has been extensively applied in various areas of physics\cite{Xu2024b, Parzuchowski:2016vi, Morris2015}.
The essence of the SRG formalism is to perform a continuous unitary (similarity) transformation of the Hamiltonian to 
drive it to a diagonal or block-diagonal form.
\begin{equation}
H(s)=U^\dagger(s)HU(s) \implies \frac{dH(s)}{ds}=[\eta(s),H(s)]
\end{equation}
where $$s\in [0,\infty]$$ is time-like flow parameter,and generator $$\eta(s)\equiv \frac{d U(s)^\dagger}{ds}U(s)$$ implicitly defines the unitary transformation.
The SRG flow equation with the Wegner generator has the structure of a double bracket equation\cite{Helmke1994}. 
 \begin{equation}
 \eta=[H^d(s),H(s)] \implies dH=[[H^d(s),H(s)],H(s)]
 \end{equation}
where $$H^d$$ is the defined "diagonal" parts of Hamiltonian.
In mathematical literature, this is recognized as a gradient flow on a manifold of unitary matrices\cite{BROCKETT199179}.
One of the most important features of the SRG transformation is its ability to separate energy scales in the Hamiltonian. 
A second-order perturbative analysis of the SRG flow reveals that the off-diagonal matrix elements decay exponentially with the flow parameter $s$:
\begin{equation}
    H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(s) \approx e^{-s \Delta_{ij}^2} H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(0),
\end{equation}
where $$H^{\text{od}}$$ denotes the off-diagonal parts of the Hamiltonian, and $$\Delta_{ij} = H_{ii}^{d} - H_{jj}^{d}$$ is the energy gap between the $i$-th and $j$-th diagonal (zeroth-order) states. 
This exponential damping suppresses couplings between states with large energy differences ($$|\Delta_{ij}| \gg 1/\sqrt{s}$$), while preserving couplings between quasidegenerate states ($$|\Delta_{ij}| \lesssim 1/\sqrt{s}$$).
However, the Wegner generator has a notable drawback: it produces a stiff set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) due to the non-uniform decay rates of different off-diagonal elements.
To address this issue, alternative generators have been proposed. For instance, the White generator and the "imaginary time" generator induce uniform suppression of all off-diagonal elements.
\begin{equation}
    H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(s) \approx e^{-s} H_{ij}^{\text{od}}(0).
    \label{eq:uniform_decay}
\end{equation}
Another distinctive feature of the Wegner generator becomes apparent when examining the second-order correlation energy expression.

\begin{equation}
    E_i^{(2)}(s)=  \sum_{k\neq i } \frac{H_{ik}^2}{\Delta_{ik}} [ 1 - e^{-2s\Delta_{ik}^2} ]
\end{equation}


This expression can be viewed as a regularized generalization of ordinary Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory. The regularization factor $$\left[1 - e^{-2s\Delta_{ik}^2}\right]$$ ensures that the energy remains finite even when two zeroth-order states become degenerate ($$\Delta_{ik} \rightarrow 0$$), thereby providing intrinsic protection against the intruder-state problem.

The Driven Similarity Renormalization Group (DSRG) was initially formulated by Evangelista as an integrated version of the SRG formalism the continuous SRG flow\cite{Evangelista:2014kt}.
 DSRG employs a memory-less source operator $$\hat{R}(s)$$ that drives the off-diagonal components of the Hamiltonian to zero as $$s \rightarrow \infty$$.
This approach replaces the set of stiff ordinary differential equations in SRG with a system of algebraic equations that are solved at each value of the flow parameter $s$.
The DSRG parametrizes the unitary transformation using an anti-Hermitian operator , analogous to unitary coupled cluster theory.
\begin{equation}
    U(s)=e^{\hat A(s)} \quad \hat{A}(s) = \hat{T}(s) - \hat{T}^\dagger(s)
\end{equation}
The cluster operator $$\hat T(s)$$ is determined by the many-body-condtion
\begin{equation}
    \hat H(s)^{od}=\hat R(s)
\end{equation}
Crucially, the source operator $$\hat{R}(s)$$ is chosen to incorporate the same regularization factor as the SRG with the Wegner generators making the DSRG intrinsically protected against the intruder-state problem.
Soon after, Li and Evangelista presented a DSRG-MRPT\cite{Li:2015iz}, and the iterative multireference method MR-LDSRG(2)\cite{Li:2016hb},
where 'L' denotes “linearized” since only the linear commutator is evaluated and '(2)' 
signals that only up to two-body operators are retained in the recursive linear commutator expansion.
Many application have show DSRG is very good \cite{Li2025,Zhao2025}.
