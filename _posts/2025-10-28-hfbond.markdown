## Background
HF is a diatomic molecule and  here we want to use it as an example to 
demostrate how to fitting spectroscopic constant.


$$
\begin{pmatrix}
 A & B \\
 B^{*}& A^{*} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
X \\
Y
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega & 0\\
0& \omega 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
X \\
Y
\end{pmatrix}
$$
In the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), the matrix B is neglected which leads to 

$$
AX=\omega X
$$
Three simplifications then yield the simplified Tamm-Dancoff approach (sTDA)
1. Neglect the responce of exchange-correlation functional
2. Evaluate the two-electron integrals as damped Coulomb interactions between transition/charge density monopoles
3. Restrict the configuration sapce to a user-specified energy range of excitations

The elements of the simplified matrix are then given as 

$$
A^\prime_{ia,jb}=\delta_{ij}\delta_{ab}(\epsilon_a-\epsilon_b)+\sum_{A,B}^{N_{atoms}}
(s_k q_{ia}^{A}\gamma_{AB}^{K}q_{jb}^B-q_{ia}^{A}\gamma_{AB}^{J}q_{jb}^B)
$$
$$q_{ia}^{A}$$ are the transition/charge density monopoles located on atom A .
These are obtained from Lowdin population analysis.
$$\epsilon_p$$ is the Kon-Sham orbital energy of orbital p.
In the spin-restricted case,$$s_k=2$$ for singlet-singlet transition ,$$s_k=0$$ for singlet-triplet exictaions.
$$\gamma_{AB}^K$$ and $$\gamma_{AB}^J$$ are the Mataga-Nishimoto-Ohno-Klopman damped Coulomb operators for exchange-type 
and Coulom-type integrals ,respectively.
$$
\gamma_{AB}^{J}=(\frac{1}{R_{AB}^\beta+(a_x\eta)^{-\beta}})^{1/\beta}
$$
